Pregnancy is an exciting time for many women, but it can also come with a range of uncomfortable symptoms. One of the most common issues experienced during pregnancy is a feeling of uncontrollable hunger. While many expectant mothers assume this is just a normal part of the experience, it could actually be caused by something else. Studies have found that a hormone called ghrelin is likely to blame for pregnancy cravings and hunger. Ghrelin is a hormone that is released by the body in response to hunger and is known to increase appetite. During pregnancy, ghrelin levels can increase, leading to a feeling of increased hunger and cravings. It is important to note that while ghrelin levels may be higher during pregnancy, this does not mean that you should eat more than normal. Eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly can help to keep ghrelin levels in check and prevent overeating. In conclusion, uncontrollable hunger during pregnancy is a common issue, but it can be caused by something other than the normal cravings associated with pregnancy. Increased levels of the hormone ghrelin are likely to blame, so it is important to be aware of this and take steps to manage your hunger and cravings.
