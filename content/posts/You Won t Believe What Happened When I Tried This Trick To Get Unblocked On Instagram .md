## Explanation of the Trick

The trick I tried is to create a new Instagram account and use it to contact the person who blocked you. You can do this by sending a direct message or commenting on their posts.

Here are the steps you need to take to use this trick:

1. Create a new Instagram account.
2. Find the person who blocked you and send them a direct message or comment on one of their posts.
3. Explain why you think you were blocked and ask to be unblocked.
4. Wait for a response.

Second, it gives you an opportunity to explain why you think you were blocked and to ask to be unblocked. Finally, it gives the person who blocked you the chance to reconsider their decision.
