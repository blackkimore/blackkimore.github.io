Pregnancy is a time of many changes, and one of them can be an increased appetite. While it is normal to feel hungrier during pregnancy, it is important to understand the underlying cause of this increased hunger. Recent research has suggested that the hormone leptin, which helps to regulate appetite and energy levels, is lower during pregnancy, leading to a feeling of constant hunger. This can be further exacerbated by the extra demands on the body during pregnancy. Therefore, it is important for pregnant women to be aware of their hunger levels and to ensure they are eating a balanced diet to meet their nutritional needs. Understanding the reasons behind increased hunger during pregnancy can help to ensure that women stay healthy and well-nourished throughout this special time.
