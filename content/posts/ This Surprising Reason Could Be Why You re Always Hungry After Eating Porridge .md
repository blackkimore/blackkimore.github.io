# This Surprising Reason Could Be Why You're Always Hungry After Eating Porridge!

It's no secret that porridge is a great breakfast choice. It's filling, nutritious, and can be made with a variety of different ingredients. But if you find yourself feeling hungry shortly after eating porridge, you may be wondering why. 

## Reasons Why Porridge Could Lead to Hunger After Eating

There are a few potential reasons why porridge could lead to hunger after eating. One is that porridge is a low-fiber food, which means it doesn't stay in your stomach for very long. This could leave you feeling hungry sooner than you would after eating a higher-fiber breakfast. 

Another reason could be that porridge is made with oats, which are high in carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are broken down quickly by the body, which means you may not feel full for very long. 

Finally, porridge is often made with milk or water, which can be low in calories. This could mean that you don't get enough calories from your breakfast to keep you full until lunchtime.

First, try adding more fiber to your porridge. This could include adding nuts, seeds, or fresh fruit to your porridge. 

Second, try adding some protein to your porridge. This could include adding nut butter, Greek yogurt, or eggs to your porridge. 

Finally, try adding some healthy fats to your porridge. This could include adding coconut oil, flaxseed oil, or avocado to your porridge. 

By adding more fiber, protein, and healthy fats to your porridge, you should be able to keep yourself full until lunchtime. 

Hopefully these tips will help you make the most of your porridge and keep you from feeling hungry after eating it.
